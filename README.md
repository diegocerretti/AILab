Here you can find the project carried out for the AI Lab course. 
Such a group project aimed at analyzing data related to cancer cells and their growth patterns next to blood vessels. We investigated on the possibility to predict the state of a cell (hypoxia or normoxia) and determine its potential danger by studying the mechanisms the cells develop to survive and resist treatments.
