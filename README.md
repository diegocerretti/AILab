Here you can find the project carried out for the AI Lab course. 
Such a group project aimed at analyzing data related to cancer cells and their growth patterns next to blood vessels. We investigated on the possibility to predict the state of a cell (hypoxia or normoxia) and determine its potential danger by studying the mechanisms the cells develop to survive and resist treatments.

Half of the files are relative to the inquiry on cells analyzed using the DropSeq technique. The other half are relative to the inquiry on those analyzed using the SmartSeq technique.

Moreover, we focused on two different cell lines: MCF7 and HCC1806. In the files named 'Xcells_...', we tried predicting the belonging of cells to either of the two cell lines starting from their expressions.
